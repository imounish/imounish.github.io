From being mad about Hindi literature, to writing my own poems and from getting hypnotized listening to beautiful lyrics, to starting my own youtube channel, this has all been a wonderful journey.

I am Shabana and I would love to tell you about my little happenings in life that brought me the greatest happiness.

My obsession for Hindi literature began in the early days of my schooling and within no time I became my Hindi teacher’s all-time favourite. Soon, I started listening to the lyrics of Anand Bakshi, Irshad Kamil, etc and fell in love with them. This is when my interest turned into admiration and I started writing my own poems and stories with the pseudonym “SHIDDAT”. Motivation and romance are my chosen genres of poetry. That little time I could spend for writing, during the most occupied days of my B.tech, gave me the utmost satisfaction. 

Thereafter, Amitabh Bhattacharya’s most famous works ‘Zalima’ from Raes and the album  ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ , made me go crazy about literature and my admiration then turned into a passion. I started my own Youtube channel with my name [SHABANA PATTAN](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEaRP9GRiSpSwpm0yoOB3cQ). It gained around 200 subscribers.  

I believe stories can convey even the deepest emotions. They are the signals within the noise. I hence began to share my podcasts ‘PYAAR PODCASTED, Heartfelt stories for you’ on different platforms like Spotify, Youtube, Apple Podcasts and 6 others. This is a Hindi podcast, also verified for Spotify Pitchfest and is gaining popularity consistently.

I never knew people would love my works exceedingly. And I never knew their appreciation would mean so much to me. Hope you turn up to listen to my podcast and help me keep up my work.  

This is my story. If you wish to share your stories with the world, do send an email at pyaarpodcasted@gmail.com.

My latest podcast is live on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4KghapZj04Smf2xvExcAMQ?si=41hIXXwrQAuFsbwcMGG3Gw). It was written by Mounish Pedagandham, and turned into a podcast by me. It's a beautiful love story of a couple struggling to express their feelings towards each other. It will be live soon on this blog.
